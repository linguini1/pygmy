# PygmyGS Enclosure

![PygmyGS Enclosure](../../docs/assets/gs-enclosure.png)

The enclosure design for the Pygmy ground station was heavily inspired by [this FreedCAD tuorial that I stumbled
across by OffsetCAD](https://youtu.be/lilkWYjUucY?si=Uf7Nz96O7UBAnQQe). I added the lid, mounting holes for threaded
inserts and some cutouts for the board peripherals. I also made the model parameterized so you can modify it depending
on what kind of inserts you have on hand, different hinge dowel sizes, case heights, etc.

This design was meant to be 3D printed and used with heat-set inserts. All screws are M3.
