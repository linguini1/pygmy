\subsection{Power}

\subsubsection{Sources}

The Pygmy is able to be powered via two interfaces. They may both be connected simultaneously, in which case the higher
of the two voltage sources is selected as the main power. This will always be the USB-C power.

\begin{itemize}
    \item USB-C
    \item JST-PH battery connector
\end{itemize}

The USB-C power is for a standard 5V USB-C connection. This is the default power supply and useful for development at
your desk.

The JST-PH battery connector is intended for connecting a 3.7V nominal 18650 or LiPo battery. Do \textbf{NOT} connect
any other battery type to this connector.

Please note that the JST-PH connector \textbf{does not have a standard polarity configuration}. The Pygmy uses the
polarity that is most widely available for drone batteries and their chargers. For this reason, the JST-PH connector has
reverse polarity protection.

\subsubsection{Regulation}

The Pygmy uses the TPS2116DRL buck converter to step down the input voltage to a nominal 3.3V. It is only rated for up
to 6V inputs, and it is rated for a maximum of 600mA of current draw.
