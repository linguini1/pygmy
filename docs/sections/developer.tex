\part{Developer Manual}

This is the developer manual, written to provide insight on design choices and explain any electrical interfaces that
are accessible in software. This section is not as rigorous as some commercial flight computer data sheets, but also
gives some expectations for current draw, suggested batteries, antennas, etc.

\subsection{Current Draw}

The total maximum current draw for all peripherals based on Table \ref{tbl:max-draw} is 462.15 milliamps.

        \hline
        MicroSD   & 163           & Very generous estimate based on 4-bit SDMMC at max speed. It should really be 30-60
        in SPI.                                                                                                         \\
        \hline
        RP2040    & 100           & Generous estimate as well based on the RP2040 datasheet examples.                   \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Maximum current draw for each component}
    \label{tbl:max-draw}
\end{table}

This total current draw permits the use of power regulation components that support up to 600mA of draw. It also
means that this device can be powered via USB, whose maximum current draw is 500mA.

\subsection{Supplies}

Using a standard 2200 milliamp-hour capacity 18650 lithium-ion battery, just under 5 hours of battery life can be
achieved assuming max draw. Typical draw should be much lower.
