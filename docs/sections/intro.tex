\part{Introduction}

The Pygmy flight computer is designed to be the rocketry flight computer for my Tripoli Rocketry Association L1
certification flight. I am a computer systems engineer (not P.Eng, I hold a B.Eng), and thus the most interesting part
of a rocket to me is the avionics systems. As such, most of the effort that's gone into my rocket is the effort that's
gone into this flight computer.

This flight computer is not intended for any application beyond flight telemetry. It is lacking any hardware for
controlling energetics. It is highly inspired by the telemetry system I helped to design as a lead on the Carleton
University InSpace rocketry design team, but has some key differences. This board is designed to be fully functional as
a flight computer that is entirely hackable. I intended for it to be used with the NuttX RTOS, but the MCU choice of the
RP2040 lends itself to novice users being able to program the board with MicroPython. I have not created any specific
MicroPython libraries for the board, though.

Hopefully this board in addition to the open schematics, software and this document can help other novice rocketry
hobbyists to try their hand at creating their own board, modifying mine or building it themselves! Please reach out if
there are any questions!
