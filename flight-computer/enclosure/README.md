# Pygmy Avionics Bay

![Pygmy Avionics Bay](../../docs/assets/bay_enclosure.png)

The Pygmy avionics bay is designed based on [this video by Matt Pritchard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxm2byxzWwo),
as well as numerous other similar bay designs I have seen online and during my time participating in
[IREC](https://www.soundingrocket.org/what-is-irec.html) rocketry competitions.

It is a convenient design that makes removing the avionics bay and changing batteries relatively easy. It is also pretty
simple design-wise to customize the mounting plate to meet the needs of your avionics system setup. Mine uses a pull-pin
switch since my university rocketry team has always used screw switches, and I have always wanted to use my "remove
before flight" tags properly. Yours may go a different arming route, or have COTS components for redundancy.

The design was made in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) and I have included the parameterized design files to make
it easier to modify.

This design was made to be 3D printed and used with heat-set inserts, then mounted on the rocket bulkhead using two
threaded rods. All screws are M3. The battery case in this design was made for a single-cell 18650 Li-Ion, but you
should be able to change the battery dimensions to fit a dual-cell or something different like a LiPo.
